======== Checking Eval ====================================================
5	passed! (2+3) [] -> (5,[])
5	passed! (2-3) [] -> (-1,[])
5	passed! (2*3) [] -> (6,[])
5	passed! (2/3) [] -> (0,[])
5	passed! (x) [(x=1)] -> (1, [(x,1)])
5	passed! (x=1) [] -> (1, [(x,1)])
5	passed! (x=1) [(y,2)] -> (1, [(x,1),(y,2)])
5	passed! (x=1 + y=2) [] -> (3, [(x,1),(y,2)])
10	passed! ( (2 * x=2) + (3 - (4 * y=2) )  ) [(z,1)] -> (-1, [(x,2), (y,2), (z,1)]
======== Checking Run ====================================================
5	passed! [1+2] [] -> (3, [])
5	passed! [x+2] [(x,1)] -> (3, [(x,1)])
5	passed! [2+1, 2+3, 3+4, 4+5] [(x,1)] -> (9, [(x,1)])
10	passed! [2+1, 2+3, 3+4, 4+5] [] -> (9, [])
10	passed! [x=2, y=3, z=4, w=(x+(y*z))] [] -> (14, [(x,2),(y,3),(z,4),(w,14)])
======== Bonus points ====================================================
10	passed! [x=2, x=(x+3), y=(x*2), z=y] [] -> (10, [(x,5),(y,10),(z,10)])
======== Your code should pass 'at most' one the following two ===========
0	failed! ( (x=(2 + x)) + (x=(x - 1)) ) [(x,10)] -> (21, [(x,9)]). Expected  <(21,[("x",9)])> Got <(23,[("x",11)])>
20	passed! ( (x=(2 + x)) + (x=(x - 1)) ) [(x,10)] -> (23, [(x,11)])
